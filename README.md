 # Motivation
  
  ## What is this project?
  
**P-EDR Arch** is a free and _open-source_ personal solution which focus is to be used in small and medium companies. It provides high flexibility, integration with new technologies and configurability. 
  
It uses a set of technologies from known brands and projects, like _Microsoft_ and _TheHive Project_, which are in constant updating, so it means that this architecture provides an extremely long product life-cycle.
  
Additionally, it has followed as a methodology, the contents that appear in ISO/IEC-27034-3:2018, a pretty much well-known standard which gives indicators to use for good practices in the crafting of application security management process.
  
  ## Why?

There are a lot of EDR solutions available to **BUY**, but these solutions are out of the economic scope for a lot of companies that have some type of infraestucture available to the Internet. Besides these organizations incorporate some type of traditional or next-generation antiviruses, with the objective of protecting their systems, more sophisticated _malware_ (like for example, _ransomware_) can pass through these defenses, compromising sensible information of clients and the company itself. In other words, if that situation happens, that would mean a serious impact from a reputational and economic point of view, which can lead to the closure if said impact is unmanageable.

**All companies should have the choice of integrating some kind of EDR solution into their systems.**

P-EDR Arch provides all the tools needed with the purpose of implementing an EDR solution to any user or company that wants it.
